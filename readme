**Python Project - Markets & Elections**

**Theory**
Our Python project examines the effects of elections on the stock market. 
Using Yahoo Finance data and our election records, we're investigating how electoral cycles influence profit opportunities and market trends.
We aim to provide practical insights into the connections between elections and finance.

**Project Goals**
- Analyzing the effects of elections on the stock market.
- Analyzing how to generate profits from elections in different countries.
- Checking if political efficacy has a different effect on the market (left/right won).

**Data**
- Yahoo Finance package.
- Election dates and data in Excel (self-made).

**Key points - Functions**
- Max_profit_calculator_yearly: This function will calculate how you could have made the most profit in an election year.
- Election_distance: This function will analyze the effect of the distance from or after the election (Does the election make the market rise or fall? Do the days before the election make the market rise or fall?)
- Left_Right_profits: This function will return...
- Market_stability: This function will return the most stable period for the market during an election year.
